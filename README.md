# Gamma-Ray-Angular-Distribution

gammappdata.db provides the FLUKA data for double-differential gamma-ray yields from proton-proton collisions at various energies ($E_{CR}$) between the pion production threshold, 1.2 GeV, and 100 GeV for a energetic proton on a static proton target. The yields are given as $d^2 N / dx d \Omega$, where $N$ is the number of gamma-rays, $\Omega$ is the solid angle, and $x = E_\gamma / E_{CR}$. For a given proton energy, a table is provided which has the $x$-value of the bin on the left side and the angular bin (in increments of $5^\circ$) along the top. The bin at the intersection then gives the yield.

The accompanying python module, gammappyield.py, provides a simple use case for the data. This function takes the primary energy and observation angle as arguments and returns a list of pairs, where the first entry is the $x$-value of the bin and the second entry is the yield. There is no interpolation between bins, the primary energy is rounded to the nearest available value. This is intended as an example from which to build on as appropriate for a given simulation.
